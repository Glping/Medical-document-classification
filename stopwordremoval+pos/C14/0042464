Trends use coronary angiography subacute phase myocardial infarction BACKGROUND patients acute reperfusion myocardial infarction patients coronary angiography METHODS RESULTS clinical outcomes rates coronary angiography late days myocardial infarction patients different centers Patients years old low- medium- high-risk groups multivariate analysis historical clinical variables first hospital days Patients early reperfusion time trends patients Mortalities day year similar time periods low- medium-risk groups mortality high-risk group proportion patients coronary angiography group low risk medium risk high risk Furthermore large percentage patients low-risk group indications coronary angiography joint task force patients coronary angiography proportion patients three-vessel coronary artery disease proportion mechanical revascularization year infarction risk groups CONCLUSIONS recent development noninvasive techniques high sensitivity high-risk patients myocardial infarction coronary angiography patients low risk complications clinical data economic consequences trend considerable impact careful analysis
