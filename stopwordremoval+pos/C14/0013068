Infusion stable prostacyclin analogue iloprost patients peripheral vascular disease lack antiplatelet effect risk thromboembolism PURPOSE Prostacyclin potent inhibitor platelet function vasodilator peripheral vascular disease aim study thrombotic status patients infusion stable prostacyclin analogue iloprost PATIENTS METHODS Thirteen patients peripheral vascular disease underwent iloprost infusion days hours day dose ranging ng/kg/minute Variable parameters thrombosis platelet reactivity shear-induced hemostatic plug formation thrombus formation collagen fiber coagulation spontaneous thrombolysis dislodgment hemostatic plugs non-anticoagulated blood samples hemostatometry hour infusion last day hours initiation infusion RESULTS Analysis data patients hour infusion changes platelet reactivity spontaneous thrombolysis coagulation patients significant platelet hyperreactivity infusion patients iloprost infusion thrombotic reaction enhanced coagulation Iloprost vitro concentration therapeutic peak blood level inhibition platelet function enhanced coagulation threshold vitro iloprost concentration anti-platelet effect spontaneous thrombolysis therapeutic blood level CONCLUSIONS findings view antagonism platelet function important factor iloprost therapy Furthermore platelet hyperreactivity patients enhanced coagulation infusion iloprost general risk thromboembolism patients prethrombotic condition
