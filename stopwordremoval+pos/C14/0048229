Response atrial natriuretic factor chronic increases atrial pressures experimental heart failure dogs Role changes heart rate atrial dimension cardiac tissue concentration BACKGROUND study role changes heart rate atrial pressure volume cardiac tissue atrial natriuretic factor ANF concentration modulation plasma ANF concentration model pacing-induced heart failure METHODS RESULTS effects acute right ventricular pacing beats/min acute volume expansion ml/min volume expansion week right ventricular plasma ANF concentration dogs group right ventricular volume expansion significant increases cardiac filling pressures atrial volume Right ventricular pacing volume expansion similar increments plasma ANF concentration pg/ml pg/ml pacing volume expansion plasma ANF concentration pg/ml little change filling pressures atrial volume repeated volume expansion week pacing significant increases left atrial volume plasma ANF concentrations pg/ml significant increases pressures Atrial ventricular tissue samples dogs heart failure group normal dogs controls groups atrial ANF ventricular ANF concentration week group atrial appendage ANF concentration versus ng/mg whereas ventricular free wall ANF concentration versus pg/mg controls severe heart failure group atrial ANF low whereas ventricular ANF concentration similar controls CONCLUSIONS data pacing-induced heart failure changes heart rate atrial pressure volume contribute plasma ANF concentration week early heart failure ANF release inability atria reduced atrial ANF concentration addition ventricle additional source ANF
