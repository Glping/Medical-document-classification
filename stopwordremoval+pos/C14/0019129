Xanthine oxidase inhibition canine infarct size BACKGROUND Evidence role xanthine oxidase myocardial reperfusion injury studies pharmacological interventions enzyme function Controversy true role xanthine oxidase reperfusion injury study xanthine oxidase inhibition myocardial injury due coronary artery occlusion reperfusion METHODS RESULTS Anesthetized dogs underwent coronary artery occlusion minutes reperfusion hours Oxypurinol mg/kg amflutizole mg/kg unrelated inhibitors xanthine oxidase vehicle minutes hours reperfusion Regional myocardial blood flow radiolabeled microspheres Infarct size tetrazolium method Myocardial infarct size percent risk region oxypurinol-treated dogs control group Infarct size amflutizole-treated dogs different control group differences rate-pressure product collateral blood flow differences infarct size Uric acid concentration coronary venous plasma reperfusion dogs vehicle drug-treated dogs oxidase inhibition drug treatment groups extent myocardial injury CONCLUSIONS cardioprotective effects allopurinol drug property oxypurinol major metabolite allopurinol beneficial effect oxypurinol unrelated inhibition superoxide formation xanthine oxidase-catalyzed oxidation xanthine hypoxanthine
