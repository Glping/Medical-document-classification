Pulmonary atelectasis signal patterns MR signal characteristics different types pulmonary atelectasis magnetic resonance MR authors obstructive atelectasis OA patients nonobstructive atelectasis NOA patients patients underwent MR studies thorax standard spin-echo sequences signal differences type atelectasis images OA NOA different spin-density-weighted images studies images cases OA hyperintense cases NOA low signal intensity Differences pathophysiology OA NOA observation OA alveolar air resorbed secretions obstructed lung increase free fluid relaxation times high signal intensity images NOA short relaxation time lung tissue absence secretions potential magnetic susceptibility effects due residual air likely responsible low signal pattern
