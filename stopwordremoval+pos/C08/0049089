Plasminogen activator suppresses endogenous fibrinolysis canine model pulmonary embolism BACKGROUND Plasminogen activator specific fast-acting inhibitor tissue-type plasminogen activator t-PA high concentrations arterial thrombi findings localization thrombus thrombus fibrinolysis study clot-bound ability clot lysis vivo METHODS RESULTS Autologous canine whole blood clots presence amounts micrograms/ml bound clots experimental conditions Control clots fibrin ogen nonbound elements lungs anesthetized dogs homogenates underwent lysis endogeneous fibrinolytic system fibrin degradation products blood control animals minutes minutes fibrin degradation product release dose-responsive manner times minutes hours equal inhibition minutes equal micrograms/ml D-dimer release clots small amounts human fibrin ogen t-PA administration effects whereas latent micrograms/ml effect clot lysis Blood levels PA PAI activity unaltered experiments CONCLUSIONS results endogenous fibrinolysis vivo localization forming thrombus important physiological mechanism subsequent thrombus stabilization
