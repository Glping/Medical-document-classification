Mechanism bronchodilator effect chronic airflow limitation OBJECTIVE mechanisms bronchodilators theophylline salbutamol influence dyspnea daily activities METHODS Twenty-four patients chronic airflow limitation multiple crossover placebo-controlled trial effect theophylline salbutamol pulmonary function dyspnea daily activities Correlations changes forced expiratory volume second maximum expiratory pressures MIPs independent variables changes dyspnea score daily activities dependent variable RESULTS drugs beneficial effects general additive synergistic drugs theophylline MIPs correlation changes dyspnea score adjustment changes MIPs correlation changes MIPs dyspnea score adjustment changes CONCLUSIONS Changes airway calibre respiratory muscle strength independent important role dyspnea daily activities patients chronic airflow limitation Changes airway calibre importance
