Reversible impairment myocardial contractility due hypercarbic acidosis isolated perfused rat heart BACKGROUND METHODS Striking increases myocardium cardiac arrest purpose present study selective effects hypercarbia distinct acidosis left ventricular contractile function oxygen utilization isolated rat heart preparation perfusate gases subset experiments H+ concentration RESULTS perfusate torr kPa left ventricular systolic pressure LVSP isolated heart maximum rate pressure change left ventricle dP/dt control values comparable acidosis absence hypercarbia minimal decreases LVSP contractility equal perfusate perfusate H+ decreases myocardial contractility oxygen consumption CONCLUSION Hypercarbia acidosis accounts decreased contractility oxygen utilization isolated perfused rat heart
