Effect antecedent glucose control cerebral function hypoglycemia OBJECTIVE incidence severe asymptomatic hypoglycemia diabetic patients cerebral adaptation low blood glucose levels effect glycemic experience hormonal EEG potential responses induced hypoglycemia slow-fall clamp RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS groups well-controlled diabetic patients patients insulinoma group diabetic patients group nondiabetic subjects group RESULTS glucose threshold epinephrine release group mM peak epinephrine response nM groups whereas symptoms blood glucose level mM Other counterregulatory responses contrast EEG changes compatible hypoglycemia subjects group blood mM group none group similar blood glucose nadirs CONCLUSIONS glycemic threshold hormonal responses falls individuals diabetes insulinomas patients likely EEG abnormalities hypoglycemia disparity increased vulnerability treated patients hypoglycemia
