Pentoxifylline resuscitation experimental hemorrhagic shock BACKGROUND Pentoxifylline improves survival animal models hemorrhagic shock purpose study physiologic effects pentoxifylline hemorrhagic shock responsible improved survival METHODS prospective blinded trials Sprague-Dawley rats resuscitation pentoxifylline RESULTS Pentoxifylline effect BP cardiac output tissue oxygenation oxygen consumption pentoxifylline resuscitation Pentoxifylline resuscitation polymorphonuclear leukocyte adhesiveness CONCLUSIONS Pentoxifylline tissue oxygenation oxygen consumption posthemorrhage effect due increased cardiac output due improved microcirculatory blood flow effect due decreased polymorphonuclear leukocyte adhesiveness pentoxifylline resuscitation
