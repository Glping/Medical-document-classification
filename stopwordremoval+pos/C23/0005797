MyoD induces growth independent differentiation normal transformed cells MyoD gene control muscle differentiation MyoD growth arrest cell lines tumors different oncogenes MyoD-induced growth inhibition reduction efficiency colony formation single-cell level MyoD growth inhibition cells muscle differentiation markers inhibitory activity MyoD acid segment necessary sufficient induction muscle differentiation basic-helix-loop-helix motif Mutants alterations basic region MyoD muscle-specific enhancer inhibited growth mutants deletions helix-loop-helix region growth Thus inhibition cell growth MyoD means parallel pathway one MyoD prototypic gene capable intracellular growth inhibitory pathways
