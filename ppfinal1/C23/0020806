 model multivessel coronary artery disease exercise stress test PURPOSE aim study determine variables diagnostic information available exercise images detection multivessel coronary artery disease model exercise stress test presence multivessel disease PATIENTS METHODS study populations patients University Virginia patients Massachusetts General Hospital evaluation chest pain patients underwent cardiac catheterization exercise stress RESULTS University Virginia cohort level abnormality defects defect defect ST depression patient age detection multivessel disease Logistic regression analysis data patients independent predictors multivessel disease initial defects ST depression age model multivessel disease variables risk multivessel disease model similar University Virginia population model accurate occurrence multivessel disease unrelated population Massachusetts General Hospital CONCLUSION nonimaging variables age exercise-induced ST depression independent information imaging data detection multivessel disease model exercise stress test probability multivessel disease populations
