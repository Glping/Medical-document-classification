 Temporal movement control patients Parkinson disease Patients Parkinson disease PD unable movement velocity environmental demands example movement amplitude PD patients constant peak velocity elderly increase peak velocity increased amplitude experiment ability PD patients duration movement different percentages maximum conditions temporal spatial control PD patients movement times control subjects able duration movement comparable temporal accuracy elderly subjects groups agonist EMG activity decreased movement duration PD patients number agonist bursts increased movement duration
