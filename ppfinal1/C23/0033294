 Effect sequential early burn wound excision closure postburn oxygen consumption OBJECTIVE effect early excision closure burns postburn hypermetabolism oxygen consumption METHODS patients deep burns total body surface underwent sequential excisions wound coverage days burn majority deep burn day addition donor site area total body surface RESULTS decrease relation percent removal burn tissue addition transient increase excision surgical procedures days response manipulation-induced bacteremias CONCLUSION early surgical excision closure burns excess total body surface postburn hypermetabolism proportion area possible open wounds form donor sites nonexcised burn sufficient hypermetabolic process
