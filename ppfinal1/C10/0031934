 Pain sickle cell disease Rates risk factors BACKGROUND AND METHODS Acute episodes pain principal symptom sickle cell disease little epidemiologic features episodes risk factors known patients high rates episodes natural history sickle cell disease patients newborns years old clinical centers United RESULTS episodes pain patient-years average rate episode patient-year sickle cell anemia episode patient-year sickle beta episode patient-year hemoglobin SC disease sickle beta -thalassemia rate groups percent patients sickle cell anemia episodes pain percent episodes year percent patients episodes year percent episodes patients sickle cell anemia years old high rates pain episodes low rates High rates high hematocrit low fetal hemoglobin levels alpha-Thalassemia effect pain association hematocrit CONCLUSIONS pain rate year measure clinical severity correlates early death patients sickle cell anemia age fetal hemoglobin level low small increments level effect pain rate survival outcome encouraging investigators hydroxyurea treatments fetal hemoglobin level
