 General principles therapy pyogenic meningitis bacterial meningitis several pharmacodynamic factors therapeutic success-when sterilization CSF Local host defense deficits CNS use bactericidal antibiotics CSF CSF antibiotic concentrations MBC necessary maximal bactericidal activity Protein low pH bacterial growth rates factors high antibiotic concentrations necessary vivo High CSF concentrations rapid bacterial important prolonged suprainhibitory concentrations low residual levels CSF prevent bacterial regrowth long dosing intervals Penetration antibiotics CSF blood-brain barrier high serum levels necessary CSF concentrations optimal bactericidal activity principles recent data rapid lytic killing bacteria CSF harmful effects brain release active products lysed bacteria rapid CSF sterilization key therapeutic goal harmful consequences bacterial lysis major challenge therapy bacterial meningitis Currently dexamethasone beneficial approach harmful effects bacterial lysis novel approaches outcome serious infection
