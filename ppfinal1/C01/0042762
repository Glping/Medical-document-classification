 Fever response elderly nursing home residents truly colder OBJECTIVE hypothesis many nursing home residents fever response maximum temperature degrees significant change temperature delta equal degrees low baseline temperature DESIGN Retrospective chart review cases infection specific criteria chart-recorded baseline infection temperatures Chart-recorded baseline temperatures re-measurement morning temperatures SETTING Nursing Home Care Unit VAMC West Los Angeles PATIENTS Random review residents charts detection infections residents period Fifty residents underwent comparison chart-determined actual re-measurement baseline temperatures RESULTS residents mean oral baseline temperature degrees SEM mean nurse-recorded measures charts Chart review infections residents episodes temperature infection mean maximum temperature Tmax infection degrees SEM episodes blunted fever response Tmax degrees fevers Tmax degrees one-fourth adequate change temperature baseline delta equal degrees degrees low baseline infections Tmax degrees CONCLUSION nursing home patient basal temperature monitoring changes temperature delta degrees threshold recognition fevers degrees degrees nursing home residents change function early recognition infections
