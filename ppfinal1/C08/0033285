 Oxygen delivery-dependent oxygen consumption acute respiratory failure OBJECTIVE oxygen consumption dependent oxygen delivery adult respiratory distress syndrome ARDS non-ARDS acute respiratory failure DESIGN Intervention study consecutive sample patients ICU diagnosis acute respiratory failure SETTING Tertiary care center PATIENTS Thirteen consecutive patients diagnosis ARDS diagnosis respiratory failure due ARDS Patients oximetric pulmonary artery catheter INTERVENTIONS application positive end-expiratory pressure PEEP cm iv infusion dobutamine micrograms/kg.min RESULTS application PEEP groups ARDS group dobutamine groups ARDS patients ARDS non-ARDS patients correlation coefficient ARDS non-ARDS patients slopes regression lines dependency ARDS non-ARDS respiratory failure oxygen extraction ratio non-ARDS patients ARDS patients CONCLUSIONS dependent wide range values acute respiratory failure dependency phenomenon ARDS respiratory failure due causes Due abnormal dependency changes oxygenation status changes mixed venous oxygen saturation ARDS
