 Whole bladder photodynamic therapy critical review present-day technology rationale development intravesical laser catheter monitoring system Present-day whole bladder photodynamic therapy WBPDT cumbersome time consuming cystoscopic ultrasonic manipulations necessary position light emitter bladder important WBPDT unsafe ineffective uniform photoirradiation accurate light dosimetry techniques bladder wall intravesical laser catheter IVLC need cystoscopy ultrasonography passage treatment fiber catheter central lumen positions light-diffusing tip center bladder Use IVLC delivery system accurate photoirradiation bladder wall inflation catheter balloon asymmetric bladder sphere diameter light sensor balloon wall method light fluence measure total light dose parameters bladder volume energy output light dose control system treatment time period photoirradiation variations laser light production energy losses transmission variations light intensity integrating sphere effect bladder wall delivery system safety WBPDT monitor treatment unsafe situation respect light fluence photoirradiation
