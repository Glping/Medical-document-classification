 Effects hydroxyurea hemoglobin water content red blood cells dogs patients sickle cell anemia rationale clinical trials hydroxyurea HU treatment sickle cell disease agent increases blood cell RBC hemoglobin content additional effect HU mean corpuscular volume MCV action HU species distinguishable fetal hemoglobin dogs drug response patients sickle cell anemia dogs patients increase MCV effect HU treatment mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration MCHC density water content RBCs species dog RBCs low MCHC high ion water content low mean density HU MCV MCHC fetal hemoglobin synthesis different pattern sickle cell patients HU treatment MCV RBCs change MCHC ion content mean density notable change sickle cell patients blood subpopulations cells HU treatment hypodense reticulocyte fraction hyperdense fraction sickled cells findings trials HU sickle cell disease possibility beneficial effect agent due increase hemoglobin associated increase MCV altered RBC density profile
