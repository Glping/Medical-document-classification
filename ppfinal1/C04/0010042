 Tumor angiogenesis metastasis correlation invasive breast carcinoma BACKGROUND Experimental evidence growth tumor certain size angiogenesis metastasis tumor angiogenesis correlates metastases breast carcinoma microvessels capillaries venules density microvessels initial invasive carcinomas patients metastases METHODS light microscopy vessels endothelial cells factor VIII microvessels field density active areas neovascularization knowledge outcome patient presence absence metastases pertinent variable RESULTS Both microvessel counts density grades metastatic disease mean SD count grade patients metastases vessels corresponding values patients metastases equal increase count field increase risk metastasis percent confidence interval microvessel count density grade distant metastases increase vessel count field increase risk distant metastasis percent confidence interval CONCLUSIONS number microvessels field areas intensive neovascularization invasive breast carcinoma independent predictor metastatic disease axillary lymph nodes distant sites Assessment tumor angiogenesis prove valuable patients early breast carcinoma aggressive therapy
