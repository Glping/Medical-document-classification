 Syncope orthostatic hypotension PURPOSE purpose study postural blood pressure response time prevalence orthostatic hypotension patients syncope relationship orthostatic hypotension recurrence symptoms PATIENTS METHODS patients syncope standardized manner Orthostatic responses standardized fashion minutes symptoms Follow-up intervals Causes syncope predetermined criteria RESULTS Orthostatic hypotension mm Hg systolic blood pressure decline patients median time minimal systolic blood pressure minute subjects patients orthostatic hypotension mm Hg mean time minimum blood pressure minutes vast majority patients significant orthostatic hypotension finding minutes Orthostatic hypotension common patients probable causes syncope recurrence syncope degree orthostatic hypotension recurrence dizziness syncope end-points patients mm Hg systolic blood pressure reductions patients degrees orthostatic blood pressure CONCLUSION Orthostatic hypotension common patients syncope vast majority patients minutes symptom recurrence follow-up patients severe orthostatic hypotension clinical significance finding future studies
