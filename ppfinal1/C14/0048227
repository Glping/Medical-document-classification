 Evidence reduced fibrinolytic activity unstable angina rest Clinical biochemical angiographic correlates BACKGROUND goal study role fibrinolytic system patients unstable angina rest transient electrocardiographic changes METHODS RESULTS Tissue plasminogen activator activity plasma comparable patients unstable angina patients stable exertional angina control patients normal coronary arteriograms contrast plasminogen activator activity plasma unstable angina group AU/ml stable angina group AU/ml controls AU/ml Coronary angiography hours last anginal episode similar extent coronary artery disease unstable stable angina groups intracoronary thrombi patients unstable angina group thrombus stable angina group chi CONCLUSIONS patients unstable angina rest fibrinolytic activity increased incidence intracoronary thrombi activity presence coronary arterial wall injury important factor development acute coronary syndromes
