 Thiamine deficiency patients congestive heart failure long-term furosemide therapy pilot study PURPOSE hypothesis long-term furosemide therapy patients congestive heart failure CHF significant thiamine deficiency urinary loss DESIGN Biochemical evaluation thiamine status hospitalized patients CHF long-term furosemide age-matched control patients trial effect intravenous thiamine cardiac performance subset patients CHF SETTING General medical ward teaching community hospital PATIENTS Twenty-three patients chronic CHF receiving furosemide age-matched control patients heart failure diuretics Daily furosemide doses mg duration furosemide therapy months Patients identifiable causes inadequate thiamine intake absorption utilization metabolic requirements INTERVENTION course intravenous thiamine mg patients CHF RESULTS high thiamine pyrophosphate effect TPPE thiamine deficiency furosemide-treated patients controls mean SE TPPE normal furosemide-treated control patients high TPPE mean SE urinary thiamine excretion furosemide-treated patients high micrograms/g creatinine micrograms/g creatinine comparison controls micrograms/g creatinine patients intravenous thiamine elevated TPPE normal mean SE normal thiamine utilization capacity Left ventricular ejection fraction patients echocardiography CONCLUSIONS preliminary findings long-term furosemide therapy significant thiamine deficiency due urinary loss contribute impaired cardiac performance patients CHF deficit appropriate thiamine supplements
