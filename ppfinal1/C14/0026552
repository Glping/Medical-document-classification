 new approach differential diagnosis regular tachycardia wide QRS complex BACKGROUND differential diagnosis tachycardia wide QRS complex equal second diagnostic mistakes frequent reasons failure available criteria new simpler criteria stepwise approach sensitivity specificity correct diagnosis METHODS RESULTS prospective analysis current criteria poor specificity differential diagnosis value new criteria stepwise approach total tachycardias widened QRS complex ventricular supraventricular sensitivity consecutive steps specificity CONCLUSIONS Current criteria differential diagnosis supraventricular tachycardia aberrant conduction ventricular tachycardia absent wrong diagnosis absence RS complex precordial leads recognizable specific diagnosis ventricular tachycardia RS complex present precordial leads RS interval msec specific ventricular tachycardia new stepwise approach diagnostic mistakes
