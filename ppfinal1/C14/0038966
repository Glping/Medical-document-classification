 Relief right ventricular angina exercise capacity long-term oxygen therapy Long-term low-flow oxygen therapy exercise capacity improved hemodynamics patients pulmonary hypertension patient severe exercise limitation anginal chest pain pulmonary hypertension right ventricular ischemia Acute oxygen therapy relief pain change exercise capacity pulmonary hypertension months oxygen therapy patient pulmonary hypertension unchanged ventricular hypertrophy marked increases exercise cardiac output exercise capacity Thus oxygen right ventricular angina development compensatory hypertrophy
