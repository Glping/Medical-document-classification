 Percutaneous balloon versus surgical commissurotomy mitral stenosis prospective randomized trial BACKGROUND prospective randomized trial percutaneous balloon commissurotomy surgical commissurotomy patients severe rheumatic mitral stenosis METHODS RESULTS Data investigators treatment assignment phase study Patients surgical commissurotomy severe mitral stenosis significant baseline differences atrial pressure versus mm Hg mitral gradient versus mm Hg mitral valve area versus follow-up balloon commissurotomy pulmonary wedge pressure mm Hg mitral gradient mm Hg mitral valve area follow-up surgical commissurotomy wedge pressure mm Hg mitral gradient mm Hg mitral valve area follow-up improvement groups Mitral area balloon commissurotomy group surgical commissurotomy group difference groups follow-up case severe mitral regurgitation group complications transseptal catheterization death stroke myocardial infarction Cost analysis balloon commissurotomy cost surgical commissurotomy countries significant savings industrialized nations CONCLUSIONS percutaneous balloon commissurotomy surgical commissurotomy result comparable hemodynamic improvement months follow-up
