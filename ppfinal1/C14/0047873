 Significance negative exercise thallium test presence critical residual stenosis thrombolysis acute myocardial infarction BACKGROUND thrombolytic therapy acute myocardial infarction emphasis early submaximal exercise testing intervention demonstrable ischemia significant residual coronary artery lesions successful thrombolysis common many patients provokable ischemia METHODS RESULTS relation significant postthrombolytic residual coronary artery disease negative early submaximal exercise tomogram consecutive patients uncomplicated myocardial infarction residual stenosis infarct artery negative test patients mean residual infarct artery stenosis Further characteristics group mean time treatment hours mean age years male anterior infarction multivessel disease ventricular ejection fraction peak creatine kinase level IU/ml similar group patients hours symptom onset mean postthrombolysis stenosis positive exercise test Characteristics group age years male anterior infarction multivessel disease ventricular ejection fraction peak creatine kinase level infarction IU/ml difference performance exercise respect systolic pressure peak heart rate time treadmill groups multivariate logistic regression peak creatine kinase level negative stress result presence significant residual stenosis odds ratio confidence interval CONCLUSIONS explanation frequent finding negative early stress tomogram successful reperfusion extensive myocardial necrosis therapy inadequate exercise performance
