 Reversible irreversible elongation ischemic myocardium response increases preload afterload BACKGROUND Left ventricular aneurysm formation myocardial infarction MI elongation infarcted tissue response stress Such elongation commonly occurs healed regions early post-MI period recent reports mature infarct regions elongation stress METHODS RESULTS assess factors post-MI left ventricular aneurysm formation strips rabbit myocardial tissue ischemic noninfarcted ventricular hours MI infarct weeks MI regions range conditions reversible irreversible length changes isolated strips hour Hz cyclical physiological peak stresses second hour peak stress stress preload increase strip length strain third hour peak resting stresses initial values reversibility length changes load Elongation increase natural strain first hour afterload similar irreversible length increases /hr infarct strips ischemic tissue length /hr versus infarcted tissue scars preload ischemic infarcted tissue reversible length increase /hr Scar strips effect preload CONCLUSIONS irreversible length increase early event aneurysm formation results afterload increases likely development preload increases ischemic tissue vulnerable afterload wall stress level scar tissue susceptible irreversible length changes infarcted tissue observation post-MI scar response increases afterload implies long-term pharmacological management afterload post-MI patients beneficial tissue elongation aneurysm formation factors wall stress hypertension exercise stress potential aneurysm formation healed infarct scars
