 NADPH glutathione status modulates sensitivity normal dehydrogenase-deficient erythrocytes dehydrogenase deficiency loss NADPH erythrocyte oxidant sensitivity elevated oxidant sensitivity arises direct consequence decreased intracellular glutathione GSH concentrations basis deficiency oxidant sensitivity effects altered GSH NADPH concentrations normal erythrocytes results study GSH depletion CDNB effect hemoglobin oxidation response peroxide systems phenazine methosulfate menadione bisulfite normal cells fourfold increase intracellular GSH concentration systems normal erythrocytes introduction NADPH-generating system purified cells significant decrease oxidant sensitivity ability cycle GSH Further experiments reduced oxidant sensitivity erythrocytes due maintenance GSH levels CDNB-mediated depletion GSH protective effect Analysis results direct correlation NADPH GSH concentration hemoglobin oxidant sensitivity
